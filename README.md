The Cinema Booking Application is a console-based software system designed to automate the process of browsing movies, selecting showtimes, reserving seats, and managing bookings in a cinema.
The application replaces manual ticket sales by providing users with a structured and efficient way to interact with cinema services through a digital interface.

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming, layered architecture, and database interaction to solve a real-world problem involving user interaction and business logic.
